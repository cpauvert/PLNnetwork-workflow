## Code

- [ ] Ask in config.yaml if stability has to be performed
- [ ] Provide custom number of bootstraps (set to 20 by default)

## Visualisation

- [ ] Report in html with snakemake
- [ ] Set the final plot with r-ggraph env (is in conda-forge)
- [ ] Set an interactive plot in the report? Just like the rule graph (check [hundo](https://github.com/pnnl/hundo)?)
